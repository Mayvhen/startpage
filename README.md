# Serch | The best search page

My friend is a genius. How to use it ?

you just need to type the wanted letter for your search, here's all the command

g *what you want to search*          | google what you type
d *what you want to search*          | duckduckgo what you type
urb *a word you want the definition* | open the definition of the word you type in urban dictionary
eval *calc*                          | to get your math done
yt *video you want to serch*         | to have a youtube search done
l *link*                             | to open a link faster
